12v 1A PSU as tested here:

12v 0.5A (not tested - too late) PSU. Similar to the one tested here but a smaller footprint. Very compact (=squished) design - update: it's now turned up, too late for this video:

Parallel resistance calculator. Unfortunately, it tells you the result of various parallel resistors not what resistors you need to achieve the result:

VH3.96 / CH3.96 cables (no idea what the difference is) from AliExpress:

This is the LED I used for a quick test, please note they WILL need heat sinks, suitable ones shown below:

Suitable heatsinks that fit exactly (and what I used):

I used thermal adhesive pad to attach the LED to the heatsink together, just cut to size, worked really well!
